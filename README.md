# Helm-Upgrader

This repository hosts a pipeline that automates the process of checking for new releases of Helm charts and upgrading to the latest version if one is found. 

## About the Pipelines
The .github/workflows directory contains a pipeline.yaml file that defines the GitHub Actions workflows used for this automated process.

Please note that the pipeline defined in the .github/workflows directory is specifically designed to run on the GitHub platform.
